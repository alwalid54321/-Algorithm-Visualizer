An advanced visualizer for various sorting algorithms. Allows users to input custom arrays, generate random arrays, and visualize different sorting techniques including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort.

## Features
- Visualize sorting algorithms step-by-step
- Input custom arrays or generate random arrays
- Adjustable array size
- Real-time iteration count display

## Algorithms Supported
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
